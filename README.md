# Features

- Make international and domestic payments on the fly.
- Responsive layout, works well on both Mobile and Desktop
- Customize popup according to your brand.
- Clear call to actions.

# Pages

There's only 1 page `index.js` that handles the entire flow.
However there are three important components to the page:

- `Navbar` - For the main navigation.
- `Hero` - For the Hero section
- `Element` - For the random elements that you see on the website.

# Tech Stack

The website is built in my favourite Tech Stack and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) for building React Components.
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling.
- [Razorpay](https://razorpay.com) for Payment Gateway.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for deployments and CI/CD.
- [TailwindMasterKit](https://tailwindmasterkit.com) for Landing Page.
